        please read the following terms and conditions carefully.
      </p>
      <h3>Rental Period</h3>
      <p>
        The rental period starts from the day you pick up the item and ends on

      </p>
      <h3>Return Condition</h3>
      <p>
        The item you rent must be returned to us in the same condition as it was
        when you received it. Any damage caused to the item during the rental
        period will be your responsibility, and you will be charged for the cost
        of repairs or replacement. You will also be responsible for any missing
        parts or accessories.
      </p>
      <h3>Extension of Rental Period</h3>
      <p>
        If you need to extend the rental period, you must notify us before the
        agreed-upon return date. We will evaluate your request and let you know
        if an extension is possible.
      </p>
      <h3>Liability</h3>
      <p>
        We are not liable for any injury, damage, or loss caused by the use of
        our rental items. It is your responsibility to use the item safely and
        correctly, and we advise you to read the user manual or instructions
        provided with the item.
      </p>
      <h3>Availability of Items</h3>
      <p>
        We make every effort to have all items available for rent at all times,
        but we cannot guarantee the availability of any item.
      </p>
      <h3>Termination of Rental Agreement</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to terminate the rental agreement at any time for
        any reason. In such an event, you will be required to return the rental
        item immediately.
